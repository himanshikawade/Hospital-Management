# 🚑 **Hospital ER Dashboard** 🏥

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard**! This **data visualization** tool provides a comprehensive overview of **Emergency Room (ER)** operations, helping hospital management track key metrics, such as **patient wait times**, **bed availability**, **patient demographics**, and **staff performance**. The dashboard empowers healthcare teams to make data-driven decisions that can improve **ER efficiency** and **patient care**.

- **📈 Performance Monitoring:** Tracks ER staff performance, including treatment times and workload distribution.
- **🏥 Bed Availability:** Monitors bed occupancy to assist in managing ER capacity.
- **💡 Wait Time Analytics:** Provides an overview of average wait times to support decision-making and optimize staffing.
- **🗂️ Interactive Reports:** Generate easy-to-understand reports for hospital management using tools like **Power BI** or **Tableau**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Data Sources:** Hospital management systems (EMR) for historical ER data.
- **Backend:** Python (for data processing and analysis).
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI / Tableau to design and display the dashboard.
- **Database:** SQL (for organizing and querying ER-related data).
